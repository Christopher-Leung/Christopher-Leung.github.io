I have finally rearranged my blog's UI and fixed issues regarding DNS with Amazon Web Services.
Hopefully from now on I can make more content on my site :)
I am (hopefully) still planning to add:
<ol>
  <li>Guide Section(How to do stuff)</li>
  <li>Random section for my own stuff</li>
  <li>Computer Science exploration section</li>
  <li>Side project section</li>
</ol>

If there's any nooks or crannies that I have missed, let me know!

Starting September 2017, I will soon be entering my last term at the University of Waterloo. Throughout my school career I have learnt a lot, improved a lot and met amazing people. It wasn't until my fourth year of university that I have realised that I am fortunate enough to love where I belong. It was not an overnight realization - it was built overtime through the challenges I have faced and the opportunities that I have tackled but failed to acheive at Waterloo. 

<h3>The motivation</h3>
I'll be dedicating this paragraph to talk a little bit about my background and how I ended up where I am today. When I've first started university, my discipline was Business Administration at Wilfrid Laurier University as well as Computer Science from University of Waterloo. At that time, I had no expectations of what I wanted to learn and experience during my undergrad career. Similar to my peers, I came to uWaterloo to be "educated" and to obtain a well paying, stable job once I graduated. Of course this is still my aim today, but at the time, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I was oblivious to the uWaterloo culture that revolved around finding the quickest path to the best jobs in the United States. 

As a freshman, I had difficulty coping with the change in pace that university provided. The difficulty of my math courses in high school was incomparable to the difficulty of Waterloo. As a uWaterloo CS student, I had an extremely hard time adapting to the new environment and had detrimented my performance in my first year. However, as I progressed in my studies, I've started understanding myself and what I wanted accomplish at uWaterloo. Around the end of second year, I droped the Business Administration degree in hope to focus on my Computer Science ability.

<h3>What I'm doing now</h3>
Now, I'm challenging myself more and more everyday; I'm constantly improving on what I know and I'm unafraid of exploring new territories of interest. I've taken a interest in reading - I've been reading various articles on my free time about self-improvement. 
As I grew more and more experienced, I've met a variety of people in a variety of different diciplines. I've taken more of a liking to academics and am starting to see the reasons as to why we need to learn what we are taught in school.

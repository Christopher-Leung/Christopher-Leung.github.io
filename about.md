Welcome to my page! My name is Chris and  I am a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. My interests include cooking, piano, building computers, and Computer Science. Similar to my interestsm my career goal is to become a software developer in fields related to AI or machine learning. When I retire, perhaps I'll become a chef; I love cooking. 

There's a lot of things that I am intersted in learning right now and I am actively trying to learn as much as I can. 
As of now I am still learning how to build a site. I will update it as I learn! :)

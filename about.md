Welcome to my page! My name is Chris and  I am a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo.
My interests include cooking, piano, building computers, and Computer Science. My career goal is to become a software developer in fields related to AI or machine learning. 

Perhaps I'll learn how to hack. There's a lot of things that I am intersted in learning right now and I am actively trying to learn as much as I can. 
As of now I am still learning how to build a site. I will update it as I learn! :)
